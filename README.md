Featherly is a project that’s close to my heart. Years ago, I built my first real-world project with Node and Express after taking a course on Udemy. That feeling of creating something people could use sparked my passion to become a Software Engineer.

Fast forward to today: that project is now old and outdated and in need of major updates. So, I’m introducing Featherly—a modern, scalable tour booking system built with Angular and NestJS. It’s a product of everything I’ve learned, and I’m excited to keep improving and adding new features over time!
